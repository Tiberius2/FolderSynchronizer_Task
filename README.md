# FolderSynchronizer

A simple folder synchronizer program which ensures that the "ReplicaFolder" matches the "SourceFolder" identically.  
The interval is set to 20 seconds.  
I'm using an MD5 third party algorithm to check if the files are equal to each other while doing the synchronization.  
A log file is created upon synchronization with all the information about what files were Copied/Updated/Deleted.  

BE SURE TO CHANGE THE PATHS FOR THE "ReplicaFolder", "SourceFolder" and "logfilePath"

Enjoy!
